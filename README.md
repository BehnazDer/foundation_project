# PawClubs
With PawClubs, I aim to build a community between dog owners and dog sitters(lovers) mainly in co-working spaces and dog-friendly companies. PawClubs aims to create a safe & fun environment for all the community members including our fluffy buddies by offering in-house dogsitters and services such as dog trianings, dog events, etc.
